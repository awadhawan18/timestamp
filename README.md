# Timestamp
Simple timestamp app for freecodecamp project.

# How it works : 
  You can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: May 15, 2017)

  If you do as above said,it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

  If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
